# Memory Game

## Description

Memory Game is one of several projects built to practice the concepts taught in Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree program and is required to graduate the program.
It is based on the popular [Concentration game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)).

**Head over [here](https://wryhder.github.io/FEND-memory-game/) to play.**

## How to Play

Click a card to turn it over. When a pair of cards match, they stay face up, but if two open cards do match, they are turned back down.
There are a total of 18 card pairs that need to be matched. The game is over when that happens.

On the score panel, you can track the number of moves you've made at any point in the game, time elapsed since you started, and the number of gems (similar to stars) left.
Each time two cards are opened, it's counted as one move.

Click the reset button to reset the game at any time.

**Note:** The cards are shuffled on each play to ensure unpredictability.
